# OpenFlops W1D
OpenFlops is an Open Hardware Floppy Disk Drive emulator/simulator.

OpenFlops W1D is a complete modification for the original OpenFlops specifically configured for use replacing the flaky Citizen W1D floppy drives, popularly used in Compaq LTE Elite laptops.

## Specifics to W1D

While this design is specifically made for the W1D when used in an LTE Elite laptop, it definitely can be used with any other floppy drive that uses the 26-pin FPC connector, it just may not fit in the same space. Heed caution.

Additionally, I made this with a few specific parts in mind - they are as follows:

* J1 - 26-pin FPC connector, part no. PCB-C5-26-SA-SMT
* OLED - Any generic 128x64 0.96" OLED (WAVGAT on AliExpress)
* SPKR1 - Piezo buzzer, part no. CPT-9019S-SMT-TR

### Summary
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk_hardware_emulator):
> Older models of computers, electronic keyboards and industrial automation often used floppy disk drives for data transfer. Older equipment may be difficult to replace or upgrade because of cost, requirement for continuous availability or unavailable upgrades. Proper operation may require operating system, software and data to be read and written from and to floppies, forcing users to maintain floppy drives on supporting systems.

> Floppy disks and floppy drives are gradually going out of production, and replacement of malfunctioning drives, and the systems hosting them, is becoming increasingly difficult. Floppy disks themselves are fragile, or may need to be replaced often. An alternative is to use a floppy disk hardware emulator, a device which appears to be a standard floppy drive to the old equipment by interfacing directly to the floppy disk controller, while storing data in another medium such as a USB thumb drive, Secure Digital card, or a shared drive on a computer network. Emulators can also be used as a higher-performance replacement for mechanical floppy disk drives. 

OpenFlops is an Open Hardware implementation of such an emulator, inspired from the ubiquitous Gotek hardware. It is designed to run the [FlashFloppy](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy) firmware, which gives it several improvements over the original Gotek:
- Can be installed on [many different platforms](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/Host-Platforms)
- Directly supports a [wide range of image formats](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/Image-Formats)
- [Flexible track layout](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/Track-Layouts) for Raw Sector Images
- [Extremely configurable](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/FF.CFG-Configuration-File)
- Supports [AutoSwap](https://github.com/keirf/FF_AutoSwap) for games with a large number of disks
- Easily accessible pin headers for connection of a [i2c display](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/Hardware-Mods#lcd-display) (either OLED or LCD), [rotary encoder](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/Hardware-Mods#rotary-encoder) (including power)
- Built-in amplified speaker, or easily-accessible pin header for an external one
- USB connector can either be soldered on the board or connected to a pin header
- Connected Motor signal
- Emulates two drives at the same time (Not yet supported by the firmware, but [it will come](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/Donations))
- Has additional 3.3V, 5V and GND power pins
- And hey, it's Open Hardware!

All of this comes in the same form factor (and mounting holes) as the board installed in the original Gotek, hence it can be easily installed in any shell or enclosure designed for it.

### Assembly and Installation
Solder all components to the board. I suggest starting with the main microcontroller (U3), as it uses an LQFP package which is tricky to solder: the recommended technique is drag soldering, there are many videos about that on YouTube, so please look there for advice. I recommend soldering the bare minimum components needed for programming and then trying to flash it right away. This way you will be able to fix your soldering without too many components getting in the way, if needed. You will need a USB/TTL Serial converter for this: one with 3.3V I/O level is recommended, but a 5V one can be used, too (most pins on STM32 microcontrollers are 5V-tolerant, so don't worry, it's not a bad hack!). You shouldn't pay more than 1-2â‚¬ for it in any case, anyway. So, when you are ready:

- Solder U3, Y1, C3 and C5, then the programming header (the top one with power, BOOT0, TX, RX, etc.)
- Check for shorts on the 3.3V power lines, you can easily do this on the pads for C6-C10
- If your USB/Serial adapter has a 3.3V output, connect it to 3.3V on the power header, then connect ground, RX and TX
- If no 3.3V output is available, solder U4 and power the board through the 5V pin on the power header

Now you should be able to [program the STM32 microcontroller](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/Firmware-Programming). If you have difficultes you can try adding R10 (and C4) and maybe a few of C6-C10, but most likely the problem will be with the solder joints on U3, as soldering this kind of package manually is never easy, so please get a lens (or even better, a microscope) and double-check your job.

The serial adapter is only necessary for the first flashing. Subsequent updates [can be done easily via USB](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/Firmware-Update).

Note that most components are necessary, but there are a few you can skip if you are feeling lazy:
- If you are not interested in the head movement sound, you can skip the following components: SPK1, D2, R5, R6, Q7.
- If your LCD/OLED display already has pull-up resistors for the SDA/SCK lines (most do), you can skip R3 and R4.

### Configuration
Please refer to the FlashFloppy wiki for the [initial setup](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/Initial-Setup) and an overview of the [available configuration options](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/FF.CFG-Configuration-File).

Some options that you will want to override the default values of, in order to take advantage of all the features OpenFlops provides, are the following:
- `motor-delay`
- `rotary`
- `display-type`

### Releases
If you want to get this board produced, you are recommended to get [the latest release](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenFlops/releases) rather than the current git version, as the latter might be under development and is not guaranteed to be working.

Every release is accompanied by its Bill Of Materials (BOM) file and any relevant notes about it, which you are recommended to read carefully.
